# Snerl 2
Perl Snippets because I am tired of not having them. Similar to any other snippet library.
This is an updated version from my old account algorithmhash. Which I am trying to gain access to.
## Background
Perl is for anyone who wants more flexibility from a programming language. It isn't dead. Here are some snippets for you to try out or even update if you find them lacking some sort of better code. Whether it be better standards, algorithm implementations etc.


## Current Focus

Current focus right now is to make it faster for one to create projects with standardized code so that projects are secure, able to scale, and easily contributable by other programmers. If writing an algorithm think about time and space complexity. If you can make it as simple as possible then great. Comment your code and try not to nest any loops. 

## How To Install & Use

You can search from the store by clicking the icon on the left of your VSC application or you can definitely use the shortcut methods:
``` 
ctrl P (Linux and Windows)
cmd + P (MacOS)
```
Then in the search just search for snerl. Should see a camel logo.
The shortkeys are as follows for searching through the snippets:

```
ctrl+alt+r+t (Windows & Linux)
shift+cmd+r+t (MacOS)

```
Then just search through the list. A list will be updated in the future and will add a project setup to better handle the project flow.

## Contributing
This is designed to make the workflow easier for said programmers and if you want to contribute make a separate branch with the naming convention of -> currentPackageVersion-newFeatureOrPatchEtc. Basically the first half is what current package you are targeting so it could be 1.5.6 but best to write it as 156 as github might complain. The second half is for which feature, issue, bug you might have found, and more as a description to better understand and organize what is going on. Do follow better commit standards and regularly commit before creating a pull request as this makes debugging, if an issue arises, easier for other maintainers and project owner. Last but not least if your check just ask and reach out and create an issue specifically detailing,in a readable manner, what exactly it is and some visual helpers like images or even gifs.
